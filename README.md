## VPN, Proxy and Tor

### Differences

#### Proxy

> Proxy is your online ID, hiding you real IP Address. It's a intermediary between your Web Browser and the internet, a web site for example. (Needs to be configured per-app basis)

#### VPN

> VPN covers 100% of you device traffic, encrypting the connection. It'll hide your real IP Address.

#### The Onion Route (Tor)

> Tor anonymizes your traffic sending it through a series of proxies, this proxies are called Nodes, that encrypts the traffic and sends to destiny using a Exit Node.

### The Tor's Power

### Why PreviewGram doesn't use Tor's Proxy by itself?

Tor have some issues, and aren't recommended to use Tor outside TorBrowser to avoid DNS Leaks and VPN+TOR issues.

### But What The F😡😡😡 talking about Tor, if PreviewGram doesn't use it???

> Because you can Access the channels via Tor
> 
> Yep, you don't need this application if you have Tor... 🙃

#### Accessing via Tor

1. Create a "Telegram Channels" Folder on Bookmarks
   - ![Create Folder](./assets/bookmarks.png)
2. To access your favorite channel, put a ``/s/`` between the domain and channel name, example: `https://t.me/previewgram` to `https://t.me/s/previewgram`
3. Save to "Telegram Channels"'s Bookmark Folder
   - ![Save to BookMark](./assets/open.png)
4. Access when you want!
5. **Extra:** make [Tor portable](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/make-tor-portable/) and use the [Mobile Tor Browser](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/mobile-tor/) to use everywhere.

## Telegram Privacy Issues

- According to VPN Mentor, Telegram "Telegram is Not as Private as it Claims" saying that they "operates with zero transparency":

- Telegram can suffer Law Enforcement

  - [Law Enforcement Authorities](https://telegram.org/privacy#8-3-law-enforcement-authorities)
- In 2020, Telegram suffered a data leak:

  - It isn't a Telegram specific problem Read [`Osint Problems`](#osint-problems), because: “Unfortunately, any contacts-based app faces the challenge of malicious users trying to upload many phone numbers and build databases that match them with user IDs – like this one.” - Telegram representative to CoinTelegraph
  - **Tip:** hide your phone number on Telegram's configurations.
- Telegram added Group Read Receipts:

> As any Social Network app, Telegram suffers with [Osint](#osint-problems) (Open-Source Intelligence), be caution with the information that you exposes publicly about yourself!

## Osint Problems:

### What is Osint?

Yeah, it's the information era, 500 milions tweets are published every day. Public informations like birthday, complete name, age are available on internet published by its own users. Which in itself poses privacy risks.

> "Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is a multi-factor (qualitative, quantitative) methodology for collecting, analyzing and making decisions about data accessible in publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context."
> Source: [Open-Source Intelligence - Wikiless](https://wikiless.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence?lang=en)

So, caution with your public information! 😉
